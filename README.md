## Installation

Assuming the user cloned this repository onto their local machine, open the index.js file. For installation, make sure node.js is installed. Run the 'npm install' command in terminal to install dependencies. Then, in the terminal run 'node index.js'.

## Usage

Once the user runs 'node index.js', the user will be asked a series of questions (seen in image 1a.). For best results, the user should answer each question accordingly. Once all questions have been answered, the readme.md file will be created based on the users responses.
